# grpcwebtext-parser

A simple script that parsed grpc-web-text and converts it to a more human friendly form. Currently can only convert grpc-web-text into human not from human to grpc-web-text. (WIP: needs to figure out the other way)

## What you need to run this?

```
node
protoc
```

Please install protoc either through chocolately(Windows) or brew(Mac).

## How to use?

```
npx grpcwebtext-parser [insert grpc text]

```
